# The Resumé of Mark Ortleb

A project to build and store my resumé written in LaTeX.


## Installation

1. Run `sudo make init`
2. Run `sudo make create-resume`


### Optional

Editing and saving the resumé LaTeX document might be easier with a tool
called TeXStudio. You can use that by running `texstudio` if you have it
installed.
